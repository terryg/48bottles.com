This is a list of issues that we need to fix before making a Mephisto
release based on Rails 2.2.

/ Try to upgrade to gem version of coderay
/ Fix TZInfo to work again
/ Security audit--see below
  Fix script/generate
  Make sure we know what's up with plugins
  We need to review our TODO comments

== Security

We need to do a basic security audit.

/ Cookies
X   Can we restrict admin cookies to /admin ? No--need /accounts, too.
/   Make sure logging out clears all relevant cookies and tokens
/   Check for session fixation attacks
/   Make sure cookies are HTTP-only whenever possible
/ Cross-site scripting
/   Turn on protect_against_forgery
/   Check all fields in comments
/     It looks like the failed comment error form has issues
/     Fix comment submission form to not use mass assignment
/   Check macro:* bodies and parameters
/     Make sure comment output is properly sanitized in any case
/     filtered_column_code_macro
/     filtered_column_flikr_macro - lots of issues
/   Do we have trackback support to check? No.
/ Password change
/   Verify token required to change e-mail and password
/ Everything else
/   Don't ship :session_key in environment.rb!
/   Do we need to override verifiable_request_format? No.
/   Check redirection in lib/authenticated_system.rb
/   Review mass assignment in public controllers - comments
/   Check regexes for ^ and $
/   Filter IMG tags
/   Block database updates on POST requests
/   Review http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html again

  Admin only
    For now, we'll assume that users with access to /admin don't try XSS
    Filter file names for uploads
    Can we block file uploads into public?  What about caching?
    Review mass assignment in admin controllers
    Only allow global admin functions on site 1 (or admin domain?)
    Can we isolate articles, etc., from admin to prevent XSS?
    Review http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html another time

  Later
    Improve password changing
    Can we use SafeERB for Liquid templates?
    Expire sessions after a while?
    Do we need to upgrade to an industrial-strength HTML sanitizer?
    Require the user to enter the old password when changing it
      This will break our password reset system--need a major fix
    Require password to change e-mail address?
    Detect mass assignment failures in unit tests - not really security issue

== Mass assignment protection

# We need to modify this and put somewhere appropriate.
ActiveRecord::Base.class_eval do
  # Raise an error if mass-assignment occurs during unit tests.  Taken from:
  # http://almosteffortless.com/2008/11/27/raising-protected-attribute-assignme
  def log_protected_attribute_removal(*attributes)
    raise "Can't mass-assign these protected attributes: #{attributes.join(', '
  end
end

== After next release

  Handle inactive users with named scopes, not acts_as_versioned
  Clean out the issue tracker
    http://ar-code.lighthouseapp.com/projects/34-mephisto
  rake rails:update:javascripts
    (complicated because mephisto/application.js depends on older versions)
  Fix sidebar tabs to do something sensible with unsaved articles
